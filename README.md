# Logic-Controlled Interactive Board
**COE322 Final Project | Lebanese American University**

##  Overview
A digital logic system with 4 switches and 4 LEDs that dynamically changes behavior based on the last switch turned off. Implements finite state machines, sequence detection, and a special "capless trick" mode.

##  Quick Setup
### Software Simulation
1. Install Altera Quartus II 
2. Open quartus files provided (.qpf & .bdf)
3. Compile and run simulations
